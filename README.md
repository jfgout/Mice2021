Analysis of expression level in Mice infected with S. pneumoniae

This repository contains all the code used to analyse the expression level of genes in an experiment of Mice infected with S. pneumoniae (or mock-infected: PBS). Mice were of two different backgrounds: wild-type and PUMA knock-out.

All the data was generated by the Thornton lab at Mississippi State (http://www.pneumolab.com/)
